# APP_KIRK (Keeping Information Replicated Kontinuously)


## Background

### Current Challenges
DataBC's currently uses FME and FME Server as the backbone for most of our
replications.  FME product uses individual scripts to perform replications.
At DataBC we try to maintain a single source / destination for each
replication script.  This has led to the current situation where we
manage more than 400 individual replications scripts.

From a DataBC perspective FME's advertised strength, of providing a visual programming
UI is also its biggest weakness.  While the ability to create complex scripts
without having to write code can save time, the flip side is maintenance costs can
be significant.

Currently we are in the process of upgrading the SDE / Geodatabase software used
in the database.  The upgrade means that the 'reader' / 'writers' in our replication
scripts need to be updated.  At a ballpark cost of 20 minutes a script multiplied by
more than 400 the update costs are significant.

### How KIRK will help
While we have many long term plans in terms of how Kirk will evolve, initially it
will accomplish the following:
- Replication configurations will get stored in a database as oppose to inside
  individual replication scripts.  This will give us better transparency and reporting
  capacity in terms of what is being replicated when.
- Kirk will re-use individual FMW's.  Most of our replications do not require the
  full suite of tools available in the FME product.  In fact most replication are
  copies of data from one place to another, with no transformations in between.
- Re-using FMW's will reduce the number of fmw's that need to get edited when we
  implement new features like incremental replications or changes to readers /
  writers.

## App current status
- KIRK is currently maintained by DSS-DPS team.
- All feature development are currently on hold.
  - This is because KIRK is dependent on the python plugin part of [the FME Framework](https://bcgov.github.io/data-publication/pages/dps_bcgw_w_databc_fme.html); and
  - the python plugin is currently being re-assessed and potentially replaced with other solution/s as per Safe software guidance.


## App description

**KIRK** moves away from conventional [FME](https://www.safe.com/) replication
configuration model where replication metadata is stored in individual scripts.

Typical Replication metadata is made up of:
   - Source dataset / table
   - Destination dataset / table
   - fieldmapping between source and destination tables
   - Data Transformations

APP_KIRK re-uses FMW scripts populating them at run time with parameters that
get retrieved from a database through a rest api.  The approach makes replication
information more transparent as replication metadata is stored in plain database
tables as oppose to embedded in individual FME scripts.

Re-using FMW's also makes it much easier for us to switch to different reader /
writers.  Also opens up the possibility to complete replications using different
replications tools.  Currently FME is the only known tool available for writing
geometries that can be consumed by both ESRI SDE and Oracle SDO.
